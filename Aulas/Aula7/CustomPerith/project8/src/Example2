    Counter 1 (s_clkEnbCnt) limits the frequency of PWM pulses
	Counter 2 (s_pwmCounter) controls duty-cycle of PWM pulses (pulse width)
	PWM frequency = system clock / ((2**number_of_bits_counter_2) * counter_1_MaxValue)

	When talking about PWM switching frequency, we mean how often the PWM output alternates between the ON and OFF states.

	The ideal PWM frequency depends on what kind of device you are controlling.

	The duty cycle of the PWM waveform is used to set the brightness of the LED.
